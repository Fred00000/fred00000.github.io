## 🔍 How It Works
DeepDefect-CV uses machine learning to identify and classify defects on steel surfaces. Here’s a brief overview:

1. **Transfer Learning**: We use pre-trained models to save you time and resources. This means you do not need to train the model from scratch.
   
2. **Confidence-Based Decision Logic**: The application gives confidence scores for its classifications. Higher scores indicate more certainty about the result.

3. **Occlusion Sensitivity Visualization**: This feature helps you see which parts of an image contribute to the defect classification. This makes the classification process more understandable.

## 📊 Features
DeepDefect-CV comes with several helpful features:

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Navigate easily through the application, even without technical knowledge.
- **Image Upload**: Upload images to check for defects quickly.
- **Classification Reports**: Get detailed reports on any defects found in the images.
- **Export Functionality**: Save your reports in various formats for easy sharing.
